# CLASSIFYING-IMAGES-INTO-ANIME-CARTOON-OR-HUMAN
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into three distinct categories: anime, cartoon, and human. Through careful training and optimization, our CNN model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 96%, demonstrating its powerful ability to differentiate between these visual styles.
